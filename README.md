Draw It
=================
A handwriting/gesture recognition application that lets the users sketch English characters, numeric characters or even characters in a foreign language on their mobile device, send the captured result to a remote cloud service, and display the results from the remote server properly on the mobile device. This application can be treated as the basis of a mobile note taking application, a mobile handwriting dictionary, or a cloud based gesture interface.
